Assignment 3 - Task 1 -> Calculate Factorial Using a Function

Method 1: Script uses recursive factorial function without importing any module to get factorial of a user input number.
Method 2: Script imports math module to calculte factorial of a user input number.
Method 3: Script uses "from math import factorial" i.e., importing ONLY factorial from math module to calculate factorial of a user input number.
Method 4: Script uses "from math import * " i.e., importing all from math module to calculate factorial of a user input number.

Assignment 3 - Task 2 -> Using the Math Module for Calculations (Square root, Logarithm and Sine of a number)

Method 1: Script uses "import math", uses explicite functions of all three said operatiions, later prints the results onto output console for a given user input number. User-defined functions are being used here for practice purpose though it might not be required.
Method 2: Script uses "from math import sqrt, log, sin" i.e., importing only specific modules, runs operations for a given user input number and prints the results onto output console. 
Method 3: Script uses "from math import *" i.e., importing all modules, runs operations for a given user input number and prints the results onto output console.
